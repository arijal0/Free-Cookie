# Interactive Cookie App

## Description
This project is an interactive GUI app built using **Kivy**, where users can enter their name, receive a welcome message, and get a virtual cookie. The app also plays sound effects when buttons are clicked. The background image and user-friendly layout make the experience enjoyable and dynamic.

## Features
- **Background Image**: The app uses a custom background image (`bg.jpg`) to enhance the visual appeal.
- **Python Logo Display**: A logo of Python is displayed at the top of the app window.
- **Text Input**: Users can input their name to personalize the app's responses.
- **Dynamic Labels**:
  - Displays a welcome message based on the user’s input.
  - Changes label text when specific buttons are pressed.
- **Cookie Image**: The app dynamically loads and displays a cookie image (`cookie.png`) after the user clicks the "Click for a cookie :)" button.
- **Sound Effects**: Plays different sounds (`click.mp3` and `yay.mp3`) when the user interacts with the app buttons.
- **Buttons**:
  1. **Get Started**: Welcomes the user based on the input name.
  2. **Clear**: Clears all the output, including the cookie image and text.
  3. **Click for a Cookie**: Displays a cookie image and personalized message.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: The core logic of the app.
- **Kivy**: Used for building the user interface.
- **Kivy Design File (.kv)**: For organizing the layout, images, and UI elements of the app.
- **SoundLoader**: For playing sound effects on button presses.
