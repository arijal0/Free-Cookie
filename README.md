# INSTRUCTIONS

## Your code
Click on the file *assignment7.py* in this assignment.  
This is the python file where you will add your code.

❗ If you need to add another python file (or additional .kv files where you enter code), click the **Add New File** button on the assignment screen under the **Your work** section (do not create the file via VSCode) -- this way the assignment can track any code you enter into the new file.


Build an interactive python GUI app:
- Please use Kivy if possible (though other GUI libraries are allowed)
- Make sure your app has at least 2 labels, 3 buttons, 2 inputs
- Each button must do a different thing
  - At least 1 of the buttons must do something based on inputs
  - Anything your buttons do must be in the app window, not in terminal (i.e., don't use `print()` statements as your button actions)
- Up to you whether you want to use a kv design file
  - ❗ If you choose to use a kivy design file (.kv), click the **Create** button above the "Kivy design file" placeholder and type in the name for your kivy design file (e.g., myapp.kv)
    - After you do this, you will see the new filename appear above the "Kivy design file" placeholder
- Add docstrings and comments where appropriate.

NOTE: If you use code copied off slides/web/AI, make sure you alter it significantly (change text, layout, sizes, locations, action outputs)
- if parts of your code are copied, but you edited it to customize what your app looks like and what it does when buttons are clicked, that is ok
- if your code was copied, and you did zero or minimal work to customize it, you will get no credit for this assignment
- if your code looks like another student's code, you will get no credit for this assignment


## Demo video
Record a demo video demo (about 15 seconds long) of your code running, text being entered, buttons being clicked

Recording the video:
  - If you are not sure how to capture video, search online for free ways to capture video on your operating system
  - If you are using your phone to capture video (this is suboptimal, but allowed), make sure you set the phone on a steady surface, and are not holding the phone in your hand (to avoid shaking)

Submitting the video:
  - Click the **Import** button above the "Video Demo" placeholder, and choose the video demo file that you had created
    - After you do this, you will see the video file appear as one of the assignment files
  - If you prefer to submit a link to your video instead of attaching a video file, you can submit the link directly on blackboard alongside your submission file


## Submission
- Make sure that none of the files have your name in the code or in the file names
- Create a submission file
  - After you click Create Submission File and choose submission file name, you will see a list of files that will be included in the submission
    - Make sure that your code, your .kv file (if you used one), and your video demo are all included in that submission before clicking Proceed
- Upload the submission file your created on blackboard


## Grading

- If you use code copied off slides/web/AI, make sure you alter it significantly (change text, layout, sizes, locations, action outputs)
  - if parts of your code are copied, but you edited it to customize what your app looks like and what it does when buttons are clicked, that is ok
  - if your code was copied, and you did zero or minimal work to customize it, you will get no credit for this assignment
  - if your code looks like another student's code, you will get no credit for this assignment

Code will be evaluated for:
1. code is written and works as intended (e.g., correct calls, correct output, no errors)
2. clean/efficient code (e.g., no unnecessary code)
3. naming conventions (e.g., class names are UpperCamelCase)
4. readability (e.g., meaningful names, separation of code into separate cells)
5. documentation (e.g., docstrings, comments, argument type specification)
